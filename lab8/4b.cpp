/*
4. Create two classes Publication and Sales. The Publication class holds title and price and the Sales class holds the total monthly sales. 
Derive a class called Book from both Publication and Sales. 
The book class stores authorâ€™s name and page count. Each of these three classes should
have a function Display() to print the information of classes and should have at least one constructor that is inherited to derived class as well. Write a program to implement these classes.
